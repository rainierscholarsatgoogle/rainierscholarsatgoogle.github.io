## About Rainier Scholars

The amazing [Rainier Scholars program](https://www.rainierscholars.org/) aims to get low-income, minority students into college... and prepare them for success after college.

## About the class

In this year's class we're introducing thirty-five 8th grade scholars to computer science with the aim to eventually improve [diversity in the field](https://diversity.google/).

The class is held from 10-12 a.m. on Saturdays, virtually on Google Meet.
