# Class roles and responsibilities

## Lecturer

The instructors for each class are responsible for the following:

*   Work with co-instructor to decide how to teach objectives for the week. (May use past years' material)
*   Coordinate with their fellow instructor to decide who will deliver which material.
*   Do at least a light-weight practice run-through of the class to work out any kinks in the material or technology
*   Print handouts. (May delegate this to Logistics Manager)

## Makeup Instructor

It is typical for at least one student to miss class each week. Thus, each week one instructor for each classroom will need to get these students caught up. Makeup instructors are responsible for the following:

*   Identify which students were absent the previous class. (See [attendance sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k32idh_KGpRYJuVuAo1wbhRtmzBL35mH-B_l3DS3Ngo/edit?ts=5e35b942#gid=0))
*   Cover material from previous class, focusing on the parts most critical for the students' overall success in the class. (And potentially leave out some pieces).
*   Cover material from _current_ class that students are missing while doing makeup.
